# How to use
## Prerequisites
You need to have `NodeJS` and `NPM` installed in your computer.
If you don't have them installed, install them from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## How to run the project
1. Fork the repository ( Recommended )
2. Clone your forked repository using `git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL`
3. Install all the dependencies using this command:
`npm install`
4. Run the project using this command:
`npm start`

## Create your own portfolio
1. Fork the repository ( Recommended )
2. Change the repository name to `https://your-github-username.github.io/` by going into settings
3. Clone the repository using `git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL`
4. To modify the First Visible page infos (Like your name, image etc), edit `src/Utils/MainItems.js` file.
5. To modify everything else, edit `src/Utils/GlobalVariables.js` file constants. For instance: Skills are in the `skills` constant. 
6. To deploy the WebApp, Run this command: `npm run deploy`

Volla!! Now, you can check your portfolio LIVE version in the `homepage` URL (`https://your-github-username.github.io/`). Github may take a while to update the `github page` into your `homepage` URL.

If the `portfolio` doesn't show ( but shows the readme file as the portfolio, in the portfolio link ), check the `settings` of your repository, and change the `source` of the `github pages` to `master` branch. If still it doesn't show, feel free to let me know via `Facebook` or `WhatsApp`

* Can I use it for making my personal/commercial portfolio? 
-> Definitely. But make sure you FORK it while doing it :)

* Can I share your portfolio link with my friends?
-> DEFINITELY! ^_^

* Can I contact you if I get stuck while trying to create my own portfolio using the forked source code?
-> DEFINITELY! :)
